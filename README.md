# Simulation-Study-of-IPTW-after-MI-in-Complex-Survey-Designs


## Study Overview

This simulation study evaluates the performance of **inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)** applied after **multiple imputation (MI)**, in the context of **complex survey data**. 

The simulation accounts for missing data, survey weights, stratification, and clustering. It follows the methodology outlined in:

## Simulation Objectives

- Generate 1,000 individuals synthetic survey data with realistic missingness and design structure
- Apply multiple imputation using predictive mean matching
- Estimate IPTW using logistic propensity score models within imputed datasets
- Assess covariate balance before and after weighting using standardized mean differences
- Fit modified Poisson regression models with survey design to estimate risk ratios
- Pool results across imputed datasets using Rubins rules
